Lower yourself as far as comfortable while maintaining balance, then return to the starting position.

Keeping your back straight, hinge at your hips to lower your upper body forward while extending the opposite leg straight behind you. Go as low as your flexibility allows, feeling a stretch in your hamstring. Return to the upright position. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n  <li>Third, One-legged Lunges: Stand on one leg and take a step forward with the other leg. Lower your body by bending both knees until your front thigh is parallel to the ground (or as low as you can comfortably go). Keep your upper body upright, and push through your front heel to return to the starting position. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n  <li>Fourth, One-legged Sidekicks: Stand on one leg with the other leg slightly lifted to the side. Perform a side kick by extending your lifted leg straight out to the side, then bring it back to the starting position. Maintain balance throughout. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.</li>\n  <li>Fifth, One-legged Front-Back Kicks: Stand on one leg with the other leg lifted slightly in front of you. Perform a front kick by extending your lifted leg forward, then immediately perform a back kick by extending it backward. Keep control and balance throughout the movement.
