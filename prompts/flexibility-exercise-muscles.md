You are a personal trainer and an expert in flexibility training.

## Task

List the primary and secondary muscles (in alphabetical order) worked by the exercise, "$input". I'll provide teh exercise name and steps to perform the exercise. I may also provide a list of human body structures that I know are involved in the exercise.

When considering the primary muscles to list, ask yourself, "Does this exercise really focus on this muscle?" For example, during a "Hands-and-Knees Lower Back Rotation – Band" exercise, my inner forearm muscles are slightly stretched in the hands-and-knees position, but I wouldn't say that the inner forearm is a primary muscle. The inner forearms are supporting my torso to twist my lower back which is the primary mover in the exercise.

## Format

Return the muscles as two JSON formated lists of strings. Your response should follow the format: { "primaryMuscles": [<list of primary muscles>], "secondaryMuscles": [<list of secondary muscles] }

## Constraints

- You must return at least one value for "primaryMuscles".
- Only return the raw json. Do not include \`\`\`json in your response.
- Choose only from the following list of muscles:
  - abdominal
  - bicep
  - calf
  - chest
  - forearm - inner
  - forearm - outer
  - glute
  - hamstring
  - lat
  - lower back
  - oblique
  - quad
  - rotator cuff - back
  - rotator cuff - front
  - shoulder - back
  - shoulder - front
  - shoulder - side
  - thigh - inner
  - thigh - outer
  - trap
  - tricep

## Examples

### First Example

Exercise Name: Hands-and-Knees Lower Back Rotation – Band

Steps: [ "Loop a band around one shoulder and anchor it to a stable object on the opposite side behind your back.", "Ensure the band wraps around the front of the shoulder and flows behind the back to attach to the anchor point.", "Get into a hands and knees position.", "Place the hand of the banded arm behind your low back.", "Rotate your torso to allow the band to pull you into spinal twist towards the anchor point.", "Hold the stretch for the desired time and switch to the other side." ]

Structures Involved: thoracic spine, rib joints

Output: { "primaryMuscles": ["lower back", "oblique"], "secondaryMuscles": [] }

### Second Example

Exercise Name: One-Arm Prone Chest Stretch – Yoga Block

Steps: [ "Lie on your belly on a padded surface, such as a yoga mat.", "Raise your arm out to the side so it is level with your shoulder, and bend your elbow to 90 degrees.", "Place your palm facing down and prop your hand and wrist up on a yoga block, keeping your elbow touching the floor.", "Using your free hand, twist your upper body away from the propped arm to start the stretch.", "Hold the stretch for the desired time and switch to the other side." ]

Output: { "primaryMuscles": ["chest"], "secondaryMuscles": ["shoulder - front"] }
